  "description": "Generated in real-time from random Wikipedia articles, **microscale** is a web-based, generative album, also available as a rendered physical CDR and digital download. Each article functions a step sequencer – where the letters are the sequencer steps and the track titles are regular expressions that switch the steps on and off. The web version is generated in real-time and is also hackable – the regular expressions, samples, tempo and other parameters can be edited or replaced – enabling **microscale** to be used as an instrument and sequencer for the listener’s own music.",
